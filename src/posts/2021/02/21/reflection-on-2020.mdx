I haven't written a blog article since August of 2020. Long time. Here's a few life updates.

I've decided that I want my blog to be rather informal. All the stuffy, professional, actually well-organized thoughts can go onto Medium. However, this blog will still consist of thoughts that are hopefully more coherent than the words I put into my daily thoughts journal.

Since reading "The Uninhabitable Earth", I have felt a calling to work in tech and climate. There's still a lot I need to figure out for myself, like what to do after undergrad, but I feel like I have a long-term career goal coming into focus.

That's it. Short blog post, but felt like I ought to write something.
