title: Remaking my Website with GatsbyJS
date: 10 August 2020

In Spring Quarter 2020, I took CS 97 at UCLA. It was an experimental course that tried addressing some pain points students had with CS 35L, a requisite class on software engineering. One key difference between 97 and 35L was the addition of a half-quarter-long team project to create a web or mobile app. My team used React Native to create a mobile app called "Workout Party". Before starting the project, I knew some JavaScript from my backend engineering experience with UCLA DevX, but I had absolutely no experience with React. I had heard of the term being tossed around before, typically in the context of "modern web and app development", but I never looked into it. Nonetheless, my team (mostly my PM tbh) pulled through and we finished our app by the submission deadline.

Armed with my 4-week whirlwind tour of React, I decided I wanted to remake my website with React. Note that the project my team and I made was with React Native, so I still had the matter of figuring out how to create a website. Prior to this, I was actually planning to re-create my website with Jekyll, but never finished. And to be honest, I didn't know Ruby, so I would've needed to learn that first.

But now I knew React.

So I turned to the other static site generator, GatsbyJS. As a React framework, Gatsby was a perfect way to use and improve the skills I learned in CS 97.

To summarize this mess though, the process of rebuilding my website looked something like:

1. Following the Gatsby tutorial
2. Building my home page
3. Realizing that I want to be cool and include a dark theme toggler
4. Figuring out how to do that with React Context
5. Realizing React Context probably isn't the right way to do it
6. Ugh, fine I'll come back to it later
7. Let's add other pages
8. Wait I want slick transitions between the pages
9. OOOOOOH right, Gatsby has _plugins_
10. Is there a plugin for doing transitions?
11. Yep, there is and [it seems pretty neat](https://transitionlink.tylerbarnes.ca/docs/anilink/)
12. Hm, it doesn't seem to do what I want
13. Let's try doing it myself
14. OK I did it myself and nothing's really working well together and this sucks, although that hand wave animation is pretty cool ðŸ˜Ž
15. Let's.... just try this over again: `git checkout -b gatsby-redo`
16. Oh neat so there are some plugins and tutorials that'll work
17. That theming tutorial was nice
18. Guess I'll have to do transitions myself after all, but I should do it intelligently this time. I really need to rethink where all my code and figure out what should be a component of what
19. Yay things are pulling together
20. I can probably push this. Push? Push.
21. Oh DUH wait I pushed the Gatsby code to `master` instead of the statically generated website
22. Wait how do I do that? _opens Gatsby tutorial again_
23. Cool, I think it's working now
24. Oops, forgot about my custom domain... how do I get that working again? I haven't needed to touch this thing in years
25. Oh great, there's a GitHub Pages tutorial on this
26. GOOD ENOUGH. Push the production build to master and it's time to move on, Summer Session A is starting

You can also check out the branches `gatsby` and `gatsby-redo` on this [website's GitHub repository to see my workflow](https://github.com/jasonjewik/jasonjewik.github.io).

Aaaaaaand that's more or less how it went. I wrote that all from memory about 2 weeks after I last touched any code (1 July), so it might not be completely accurate but re-reading it almost a month and a half later (10 August), there's still some valuable takeaways here:

1. Make sure you know what you're getting into when starting a project
   - Sketch it out first
   - What plugins or tools are available so you don't have to re-invent the wheel
2. Think about what needs to be a component of what first (kinda ties into the "sketch it out first" point)
   - It took a while for me to think in terms of composition instead of inheritance
3. Think about how components are going to interact with each other, then design them based on that
   - In my case, part of the reason why I had to a soft restart half-way through the redesign is because I did not set up my component tree in a way that was friendly to incorporating page transitions

And why did I do this? For fun. And also because React's sort of an important skill to know.

What's next for my website?

- Finish the project page
- Make it mobile-friendly
- Figure out what is appropriate to post on my blog
  - Figure out what tone I want to use for my blog
  - Although I'll probably leave this post up since it'll be probably be a useful way for me to remember how I did this
